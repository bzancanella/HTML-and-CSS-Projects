		<blockquote cite="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Invertebrates/Bees"><i>"Both domesticated honey bees and many native bee species are in decline. In fact some species, such as the once-common rusty patched bumblebee, are now listed as endangered in the U.S. Potential causes of these declines include habitat destruction, disease, agricultural and lawn and garden practices, use of pesticides, habitat fragmentation, changes in land use, invasive species, and climate change.</i></blockquote>
